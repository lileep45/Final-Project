<p>Hello, this is all about me. I am an Information Science Major at MSU, with a specialization in Information and society. </p>
<ul>I am a Senior, with my major switched several times before deciding on Information Science. I believe Information Science is a very broad, yet fulfilling major with a high difficulty in learning.</ul>
