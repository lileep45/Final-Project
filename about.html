<h1>Hello, this is all about me. I am an Information Science Major at MSU, with a specialization in Information and society. </h1>
<h3>I am a Senior, with my major switched several times before deciding on Information Science. I believe Information Science is a very broad, yet fulfilling major with a high difficulty in learning. I started my Major in 2020, the same year Information Science opened up at MSU as a major. When I am not doing schoolwork, I like to play the Nintendo Switch.</h3>
